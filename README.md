# login-page
Trying to learn more about Git, GitHub, File IO, and Swing GUIs by creating a text editor with a login page.

Ideas:
- [ ] allow users to change file names in editor (possible, but make it more explicit?)
- [X] allow users to change their passwords (should usernames be changeable?)
- [X] allow for different users to login, how to save user info?
- [X] add feature to set username and password
- [ ] make it so files can only be opened by certain users (encrypt files?)
- [X] allow users to close current document without exiting program
- [X] make a method to give warnings if the user is trying to exit a file with unsaved changes
- [ ] add undo and redo buttons under Edit menu
- [ ] add warning when quitting using Quit Main (Command Q)
- [ ] give users the option to change background colors for certain panels

More things to learn about:
- using RegEx
- unit testing
