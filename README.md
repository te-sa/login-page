# login-page
Trying to learn more about Git, GitHub, File IO, and Swing GUIs by creating a text editor with a login page.

Ideas:
- [ ] allow users to change file names in editor
- [ ] allow for different users to login, how to save user info?
- [ ] add feature to set username and password
- [ ] make it so files can only be opened by certain users (encrypt files?)
